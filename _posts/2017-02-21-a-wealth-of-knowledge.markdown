One of the best things about YouTube, in my opinion, is the amount of videos available from colleges and universities around the world. If you haven’t seen this for yourself, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=university+or+college&amp;filters=channel&amp;lclk=channel">searching</a> YouTube Channels for the word “college” or “university.” Literally every major institution of higher education has a Channel. But be warned, this will undoubtedly lead to  a YouTube Spiral</a>.

Here at Microsearch, we love adding to our education by watching these freely available videos. To that end, and to show off the amazing capabilities of our new Video Search product, we decided to create a collection of all the publicly-available videos from each of the Ivy League schools, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell, Princeton, and UPenn. We thought this would be a cool idea, but we didn’t realize how amazing it really is to have all of that educational content in one place until we put the Video Search site together and started running searches.

Try it for yourself. Think of any topic you’d like to learn a little more about, drop it into the search field, and be prepared to spend hours learning from some of the greatest minds of our generation. For example, I’m really interested in the emerging field of “Digital Humanities,” so I ran a quick search and found hundreds of videos on the topic. From there, I tried searching “politics,” “biochemistry,” and “climate change.” In less than a second, Video Search responds with a seemingly endless list of videos to watch.

Once you click into one of the videos, not only can you watch the whole video right there in the same window, but you can also read the transcript as it scrolls in time with the video. Your search query is highlighted, and you can easily jump between results in the transcript. If you find something you like and want to share, just highlight the transcript and a link is created that jumps right to that spot in the video. You can share it via Facebook, Twitter, or email.

So what are you interested in? Check out the demo below, and let us know what you think in the comments section. Also, what other kinds of video collections would you be interested in seeing?
