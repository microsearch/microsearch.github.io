                        As part of the full MultimediaSearch solution, we can convert your paper documents and old videos in any format--reel, VHS, DVD, etc.--into digital files, complete with transcripts, and incorporated into your own online library.

                        MultimediaSearch makes your documents (digital or paper) and video transcripts (automatically created or professionally generated) infinitely more valuable by indexing every word for full search capabilities.

                      Your documents and videos can be a valuable SEO tool, but if their text is not fully indexed and if they're hosted offsite, you're not getting that value. MultimediaSearch ensures that web traffic generated by your docs and videos comes to your site and stays there!

                  <p>

                  MicroSearch Corporation was founded in 1996 near Boston. We are a boutique search engine company, and provide private and secure video and document search engine services for client organizations across the country.</p>
                  <p>We index client video transcripts and documents into searchable digital databases, and host those databases online in public or private secure web portals.</p>
                  <p>A database portal may contain thousands of video transcripts or documents, together with all of the related metadata, all readily accessible on any internet connected device.</p>
                  <p>Each indexed database is hosted in a web portal; the web portal may be private and secure, or it may be open and public. Public libraries, for instance, use public web portals, while Research Associations generally have private, secure web portals. Each of our client web portals has been highly customized to give each client exactly the search and retrieval experience they desire.</p>
                  <p>VideoSearch is the latest video management service from MicroSearch, and is a service that makes client videos more useful and valuable by providing new viewer enhancement features to client videos: Find, Navigate, Clip.</p>
