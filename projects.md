<h2>Video &amp; Document Conversion</h2>
<h3>From Paper Documents to Online Collection</h3>

<p>
  Even if your important documents are mostly printed on paper or your videos are on VHS, we can make them fully searchable. For documents, our enhanced scanning and character recognition technology preserves the original look of the document, while embedding a layer of hidden, fully-searchable text beneath. For videos, we can make a digital version of your tapes, transcribe any spoken text, and provide a fully searchable transcript. Have a mix of documents and videos? No problem! We can combine them into one online MultimediaSearch database. <a href="/services/video-document-conversion/">Learn more...</a>

  Moving to the cloud is a great idea for any organization of any size, but we think that once you're on the cloud, you're only half way there. We are a search company. For nearly two decades we've been helping clients gain faster, more efficient access to their information. At first, that information was on CD-ROMS, then Web 1.0 document databases, and today we're proud to offer full-text search solutions for documents <i>and</i> videos hosted in the cloud. <a href="/services/search/">Learn more...</a>

<h3>Make your videos perform for you</h3>

<p>
  You have a YouTube Channel or Vimeo Page--plenty of videos, but not a lot of viewers. MultimediaSearch can help. We provide transcripts for all your videos, index them, and make them fully searchable. Then, we collect your videos into your own MultimediaSearch library and embed it on your website. Viewers can search, find, watch, and share your videos without leaving your page. <a href="/services/seo/">Learn more...</a>

  Online videos can be an indispensable educational tool. But keeping track of media can feel like a full time job. Thatâ€™s where we come in. VideoSearch from Microsearch lets you collect all your videos into one searchable library and publish it on a personalized website. No more sending students to YouTube, where distractions abound. <a href="education/">Learn more...</a>

<h2>Video Clip &amp; Share</h2>
<h3>Read along with the transcript of a video in real time.</h3>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/social.jpg" /></a>
<p>
With MultimediaSearch, your videos are also your documents. You can read a transcript as it scrolls along side your video. Clicking a line in the transcript will jump to the part of the video in which the line is spoken. But have you ever wanted to share a particular clip of a video? Now you can. <a href="clipping/">Learn more...</a>
