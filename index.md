homecol3text: Your documents and videos can be a valuable SEO tool, but if their text
  is not fully indexed and if they're hosted offsite, you're not getting that value.
  MultimediaSearch ensures that web traffic generated by your docs and videos comes
  to your site and stays there!

homecol4text: Online videos can be an indispensable educational tool. But keeping
  track of media can feel like a full time job. Thatâ€™s where we come in. VideoSearch
  from Microsearch lets you collect all your videos into one searchable library and
  publish it on a personalized website. No more sending students to YouTube, where
  distractions abound.

homecol5text: With MultimediaSearch, your videos are also your documents. You can
  read a transcript as it scrolls along side your video. Clicking a line in the transcript
  will jump to the part of the video in which the line is spoken. But have you ever
  wanted to share a particular clip of a video? Now you can.
