col1text: With MultimediaSearch, your videos are also your documents. You can read
  a transcript as it scrolls along side your video. Clicking a line in the transcript
  will jump to the part of the video in which the line is spoken. But have you ever
  wanted to share a particular clip of a video? Now you can...

col2text: We all know how a highlighter works; you're reading on paper when suddenly
  a few words or a sentence jumps off the page at you and you just have to mark it
  and save it for later. Imagine being able to highlight a line in an online video
  and then email it to yourself or others or share it on social media. MultimediaSearch
  brings the trusty highlighter into the twenty-first century and makes it easy to share video clips.

col3text: Imagine you're watching a video online and there's a part somewhere in the
  middle of the video that you want to share with your friends or followers. But how to direct
  them to that exact moment in the video? You could tell them to jump to a certain
  point in time, or, with MultimediaSearch, you could highlight just the clip you
  want to share and a link will be automatically created that will take them to the
  exact moment your clip begins. Revolutionary, right?
