col1text: But you already knew that. Contemporary syllabi feature links to all kinds
  of videos, from news items to lectures. That means your video content is spread
  across the web, not housed where it should be, on your website. Centralize your
  video content. Your students will thank you.

col2text: Online videos can be an indispensable educational tool. But keeping track
  of media can feel like a full time job. Thatâ€™s where we come in. VideoSearch from
  Microsearch lets you collect all your videos into one searchable library and publish
  it on a personalized website. No more sending students to YouTube, where distractions
  abound.
