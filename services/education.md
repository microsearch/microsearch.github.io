col1text: Online video drives online education. But you already knew that. Contemporary syllabi and learning management systems feature links to all kinds
  of videos, from news items to lectures. That means your video content is spread
  across the web, not housed where it should be, on your website. Centralize your
  video content. Your students will thank you.

  Microsearch lets you collect all your documents videos into one searchable library and publish
  it on a personalized website as your own personal LMS. No more sending students to YouTube, where distractions
