col2text: While the media on which your video was recorded may have gone out of date,
  that doesn't mean the content of the video is no longer valuable. We provide video conversion--from analog to digital--and incorporated in your MultimediaSearch site,
  an online database and digital library. We can take it from gathering dust to fully
  indexed and searchable.
