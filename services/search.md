col1head: Video Transcripts are Good. Searchable Transcripts are Better.

col1text: Whether your video transcripts are automatically (and imperfectly) created
  by YouTube, or you pay for professionally generated, highly accurate video transcriptions,
  their value is unlocked by making them fully searchable. MultimediaSearch does just
  that.
col2head: Full Text Search + Metadata = Everything
col2img: search.jpg
col2text: MultimediaSearch isn't just about full-text search, though that is a powerful
  tool. We also index metadata--information about the documents--that is also searchable.
  So, for example, you can find a document that contains a particular string of text
  and printed on a particular date. The only limit to the metadata we can index is
  the information you can provide us.
col3head: Search Your Way to Answers
col3img: searchcomp.jpg
col3text: Typically, the only way to navigate online videos is by clicking the timing
  bar at the bottom of a video player. But this is inefficient. With fully indexed
  searchable transcripts, users can search their way into a video and even skip to
  the content they're interested in by clicking the transcript.
