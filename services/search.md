col1text: Whether your content is videos, documents, or a mix of both, MultimediaSearch
  is the answer. MultimediaSearch is a fully searchable document management service
  paired with the industry's best video management service, combined. Browse your
  documents and videos in our industry-leading table of contents, or search full text
  and meta-data across your entire collection.
col2head: Full Text Search + Metadata = Everything

col2text: MultimediaSearch isn't just about full-text search, though that is a powerful
  tool. We also index metadata--information about the documents--that is also searchable.
  So, for example, you can find a document that contains a particular string of text
  and printed on a particular date. The only limit to the metadata we can index is
  the information you can provide us.

col3text: Typically, the only way to navigate online videos is by clicking the timing
  bar at the bottom of a video player. But this is inefficient. With fully indexed
  searchable transcripts, users can search their way into a video and even skip to
  the content they're interested in by clicking the transcript.
