Below are a few demos highlighting <strong>VideoSearch</strong>'s capabilities. (If you'd like a custom demo using your own video content, don't hesitate to [get in touch](../contact/).

- **[Ivy League Videos](ivy-league-videos/)**  
We compiled all publicly-available videos from the 8 Ivy League schools, plus MIT, and then indexed their transcripts to make them fully searchable. Give it a try by inserting your own search term and pressing *Search*. You can read our blog about this demo here.

- **[University Videos](http://universityvideos.org/Home/){:target="_blank"}**  
This new MultimediaSearch portal contains the metadata of the YouTube Channels of the world's Top Universities. Viewing University Videos within the portal provides viewer-enhancements that will make these videos attract and keep more viewers. There are four main user-enhancement features to watch for:  
  - Video transcript plays in sync with the playing video, enhancing the user experience
  - Video Search - enhanced and advanced search capabilities, plus hit to hit navigation
  - Video Clip and Share - instant and automatic sharing of important video clips
  - Video Transcript Navigation, allowing viewers to jump to any spot in the video
